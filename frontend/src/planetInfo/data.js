      information:
        "Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system and the closest to the Sun. With a diameter of 4,880 kilometers, it's only slightly larger than Earth's Moon. Mercury has a heavily cratered surface resembling our Moon, with vast smooth plains and towering cliffs called lobate scarps that can be hundreds of kilometers long and up to a kilometer high. These scarps formed as Mercury's interior cooled and contracted. The planet has an enormous iron core that makes up about 85% of its radius, generating a magnetic field about 1% as strong as Earth's. Mercury's surface experiences extreme temperature variations, ranging from -173°C at night to 427°C during the day - the most extreme temperature swings in the solar system. This occurs because Mercury has virtually no atmosphere to retain heat. What little atmosphere exists consists mainly of oxygen, sodium, hydrogen, helium, and potassium atoms blasted off its surface by solar radiation. Mercury orbits the Sun every 88 Earth days at an average distance of 58 million kilometers, but its slow rotation (59 Earth days) creates a unique situation where a day on Mercury (sunrise to sunrise) lasts 176 Earth days. The MESSENGER spacecraft discovered water ice in permanently shadowed craters at Mercury's poles in 2012, likely deposited by comet impacts. Mercury has been visited by only two spacecraft: Mariner 10 in 1974-75 and MESSENGER from 2008-2015.",

      information:
        "Venus, Earth's 'sister planet', is the second planet from the Sun and the hottest world in our solar system despite being farther from the Sun than Mercury. With a diameter of 12,104 km, it's nearly identical in size to Earth but has a radically different environment. Venus rotates backwards (retrograde rotation) compared to most planets, with one Venusian day lasting 243 Earth days—longer than its year of 225 Earth days. Its thick atmosphere is 96.5% carbon dioxide with clouds of sulfuric acid, creating a runaway greenhouse effect that traps heat and raises surface temperatures to a scorching 462°C (864°F)—hot enough to melt lead. The atmospheric pressure at the surface is 92 times Earth's, equivalent to being 900 meters underwater. Venus's surface is young (300-600 million years old) with extensive volcanic features, including vast lava plains, shield volcanoes, and unique pancake-shaped domes called 'farra'. The planet has no moons or rings, and its weak magnetic field is induced by solar wind interacting with the upper atmosphere rather than a core dynamo. Over 40 spacecraft have visited Venus, with the Soviet Venera program achieving the first (and only) successful landings in the 1970s-80s. Recent missions like ESA's Venus Express (2006-2014) and Japan's Akatsuki (2015-present) study its super-rotating atmosphere, where clouds circle the planet every 4 Earth days while the surface below barely moves. Venus shines brighter than any star in Earth's night sky, earning it the names 'Morning Star' and 'Evening Star'.",

        "Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only known astronomical object to harbor life. With a diameter of 12,742 km, it's the largest and most massive of the terrestrial planets. Earth's atmosphere consists of 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and trace amounts of other gases including argon and carbon dioxide. This composition is maintained by Earth's biosphere—the global ecological system integrating all living organisms and their interactions. Earth's surface is 70.8% water (mostly oceans) and 29.2% land organized into tectonic plates that slowly move across the surface over geological timescales. The planet's iron-nickel core generates a protective magnetic field that deflects harmful solar radiation. Earth has one natural satellite, the Moon, which stabilizes its axial tilt and creates ocean tides. Earth's rotation period of 23 hours 56 minutes creates day-night cycles, while its 23.5° axial tilt produces seasons. Human civilization has significantly altered Earth's surface and atmosphere since the Industrial Revolution, with measurable impacts on climate and ecosystems. Over 8,000 artificial satellites orbit Earth, supporting communications, navigation, and scientific research. Earth remains the only planet where life is known to exist, with an estimated 8.7 million species, of which only about 1.2 million have been cataloged. Ongoing studies focus on climate change, biodiversity loss, and sustainable development to preserve Earth's unique habitability.",

      information:
        "Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System after Mercury. Often called the 'Red Planet' due to its reddish appearance from iron oxide (rust) on its surface, Mars has a diameter of 6,779 km, about half that of Earth. The planet has a thin atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide (95.3%), nitrogen (2.7%), and argon (1.6%), with traces of oxygen and water vapor. Mars has surface features reminiscent both of Earth's impact craters and volcanoes, valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps. Olympus Mons, the largest volcano and highest known mountain in the Solar System at 21.9 km high, is located on Mars, while Valles Marineris is a system of canyons that dwarfs the Grand Canyon, stretching over 4,000 km long and up to 7 km deep. Mars has two small, irregularly shaped moons, Phobos and Deimos, which may be captured asteroids. The planet's rotation period and axial tilt are similar to Earth's, producing seasons, though a Martian year lasts about 687 Earth days. Current surface conditions make liquid water unstable, though seasonal flows of briny water may occur. Evidence suggests Mars was once much more Earth-like, with a thicker atmosphere and abundant water that flowed in rivers and lakes. Numerous robotic spacecraft, including orbiters, landers, and rovers, have explored Mars, with NASA's Perseverance rover (landed 2021) actively searching for signs of ancient microbial life in Jezero Crater, a former lakebed. Future human colonization plans target Mars due to its relative accessibility and resources.",

      information:
        "Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in our solar system – more than twice as massive as all other planets combined. This gas giant has a diameter of 139,820 km (11 times wider than Earth) and a composition similar to the Sun, primarily hydrogen (90%) and helium (10%), with traces of methane, water vapor, ammonia, and other compounds. Jupiter's most famous feature is the Great Red Spot, a persistent high-pressure storm larger than Earth that has raged for at least 400 years. The planet has a powerful magnetic field 14 times stronger than Earth's, creating intense radiation belts and spectacular auroras. Jupiter's rapid rotation (9.9 hours) causes its atmosphere to form distinctive banded cloud patterns and generates the strongest jet streams in the solar system (up to 600 km/h). Though lacking a solid surface, Jupiter may have a dense core of heavier elements surrounded by a layer of metallic hydrogen that generates its magnetic field. The planet has a faint ring system and at least 95 known moons, including the four large Galilean moons (Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto) discovered by Galileo in 1610. Jupiter's immense gravity influences the solar system, deflecting comets and asteroids while capturing some as temporary moons. NASA's Juno spacecraft (arrived 2016) continues to study Jupiter's composition, gravity field, magnetic field, and polar magnetosphere, revealing stunning details about its turbulent atmosphere and interior structure.",

      information:
        "Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in our solar system, famous for its spectacular ring system. With a diameter of 116,460 km (9 times wider than Earth), this gas giant is composed primarily of hydrogen (96%) and helium (3%), with traces of methane, ammonia, and other compounds. Saturn's most distinctive feature is its complex system of icy rings, which extend up to 282,000 km from the planet but are only about 20 meters thick on average. The rings are composed mostly of water ice particles ranging in size from dust grains to boulders. Saturn has the lowest density of all planets - it would float in water if a large enough ocean could be found. The planet has a rapid rotation period of 10.7 hours, causing it to bulge at the equator and flatten at the poles. Saturn's atmosphere features banded cloud patterns similar to Jupiter's but with fainter coloration, and occasional giant storms. The planet has a hot interior, radiating 2.5 times more energy than it receives from the Sun. Saturn possesses a strong magnetic field about 578 times more powerful than Earth's. The planet has at least 146 moons, more than any other planet, including Titan (larger than Mercury) which has a thick nitrogen atmosphere and liquid hydrocarbon lakes. The Cassini spacecraft (2004-2017) provided unprecedented details about Saturn's atmosphere, rings, and moons, discovering geysers on Enceladus and complex weather patterns on Saturn itself. Saturn's rings are relatively young, likely forming between 10-100 million years ago from the destruction of an icy moon or comet.",

      information:
        "Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and the third-largest in our solar system. Discovered in 1781 by William Herschel, this ice giant has a diameter of 50,724 km (about 4 times wider than Earth) and is unique for its extreme axial tilt of 98°, causing it to essentially rotate on its side. Uranus is composed primarily of hydrogen (83%), helium (15%), and methane (2%), with the methane giving the planet its distinctive blue-green color. Unlike Jupiter and Saturn, Uranus lacks a deep metallic hydrogen layer and instead has a mantle of icy materials (water, ammonia, and methane ices) surrounding a small rocky core. The planet has a complex, layered cloud structure with temperatures as low as -224°C, making it the coldest planet in the solar system. Uranus has a faint ring system and 28 known moons, named after characters from Shakespeare and Alexander Pope. The five major moons are Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon. Uranus's magnetic field is peculiar—it's tilted 59° from its rotational axis and offset from the planet's center. The planet takes 84 Earth years to complete one orbit around the Sun. Only one spacecraft, Voyager 2 in 1986, has visited Uranus, providing most of our current knowledge about this enigmatic world. Uranus's unusual seasons (each lasting about 21 Earth years) and lack of significant internal heat source remain subjects of scientific study.",

      information:
        "Neptune is the eighth and most distant planet from the Sun, discovered in 1846 through mathematical predictions rather than direct observation. This ice giant has a diameter of 49,244 km (about 4 times wider than Earth) and is composed primarily of hydrogen (80%), helium (19%), and methane (1%), with the methane giving the planet its striking deep blue color. Neptune has the strongest winds in the solar system, reaching speeds of 2,100 km/h (1,300 mph), powered by internal heat radiating 2.6 times more energy than it receives from the Sun. The planet's atmosphere features dynamic weather systems, including the Great Dark Spot (a massive storm similar to Jupiter's Great Red Spot) and bright cirrus clouds of methane ice crystals. Neptune has a faint ring system and 16 known moons, with Triton being the largest - a captured Kuiper Belt object with active geysers of nitrogen gas. Neptune's magnetic field is tilted 47° from its rotational axis and offset from the planet's center. The planet takes 165 Earth years to complete one orbit around the Sun. Only one spacecraft, Voyager 2 in 1989, has visited Neptune, providing most of our current knowledge about this distant world. Recent observations from the James Webb Space Telescope have revealed new details about Neptune's atmospheric circulation and weather patterns. Neptune's extreme seasons (each lasting about 40 Earth years) and its unexpectedly dynamic atmosphere continue to intrigue scientists.",
